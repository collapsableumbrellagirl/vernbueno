- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vernbueno, a tech recruiter for software companies. I used to help run a javascript meetup when I thought I wanted to be a developer and that's how I started my github awhile back.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in maybe recruiting you, but mostly to connect and build stuff to make my job as a recruiter easier. I'm taking inspiration from Sourcers Who Code Fbook group
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development - i've gotten as far as making a table with basic css by watching Colt Steele lol
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronicabueno/
