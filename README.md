- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vernbueno, a tech recruiter for software companies. I used to help run a javascript meetup and that's when I decided to start my github account 2 years ago. I still don't know what i'm doing.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in maybe recruiting you, but mostly to build stuff to make my job as a recruiter easier. I'm taking inspiration from Sourcers Who Code Fbook group
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development - i've gotten as far as making a table with basic css by watching the infamous Colt Steele lol
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronicabueno/
